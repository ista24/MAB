# Datasets Description for Multi-Armed Bandit Simulations

This repository contains two datasets utilized in our Multi-Armed Bandit simulations. These datasets were used to evaluate the performance of our Proposed Approach in comparison with established algorithms such as epsilon-greedy and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) strategies. Each dataset provided unique insights into various aspects of decision-making processes.

## Ad Dataset

The Ad dataset comprises aggregated advertisement interaction data, essential for understanding user engagement and click-through rates (CTR). This dataset was instrumental in simulating an environment where each 'arm' corresponds to a different advertising strategy. The data includes counts of ad displays and user clicks, allowing the computation of CTR for each advertisement.

## Election Campaign Dataset

The Election Campaign dataset encapsulates the various outreach strategies employed during an election campaign. The core information within this dataset revolves around the rewards associated with different campaign actions. The rewards here represent the efficacy of each action in engaging potential voters.

Our simulation leverages this dataset to replicate a scenario where decisions must be made under conditions mirroring the uncertainty and dynamics of real-life election campaigns.

## Acknowledgments

We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the creators and maintainers of the datasets used in this research. Their meticulous work in assembling and sharing their data has greatly facilitated our exploration into decision-making algorithms.

For the Ad Dataset, our thanks go to 
 GuilongAaron/beta_distribution_adprediction(https://github.com/GuilongAaron/beta_distribution_adprediction)). Their dataset has provided us with invaluable insights into user engagement and ad effectiveness.
