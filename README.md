# Datasets Description for Multi-Armed Bandit Simulations

This repository contains two datasets utilized in our Multi-Armed Bandit simulations. These datasets were used to evaluate the performance of our Proposed Approach in comparison with established algorithms such as epsilon-greedy and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) strategies. Each dataset provided unique insights into various aspects of decision-making processes.

## Ad Dataset

The Ad dataset comprises aggregated advertisement interaction data, essential for understanding user engagement and click-through rates (CTR). This dataset was instrumental in simulating an environment where each 'arm' corresponds to a different advertising strategy. The data includes counts of ad displays and user clicks, allowing the computation of CTR for each advertisement.

We extend our gratitude to the creators and maintainers of the original dataset. Their effort in compiling and making this data accessible has been pivotal in advancing the research within this domain.

## Election Campaign Dataset

The Election Campaign dataset encapsulates the various outreach strategies employed during an election campaign. The core information within this dataset revolves around the rewards associated with different campaign actions. The rewards here represent the efficacy of each action in engaging potential voters.

Our simulation leverages this dataset to replicate a scenario where decisions must be made under conditions mirroring the uncertainty and dynamics of real-life election campaigns.

## Acknowledgments

We acknowledge the original sources of these datasets. Their dedication to collecting, curating, and sharing data has contributed immensely to the field of data-driven decision-making. It is through their work that we are able to explore and innovate within this space.

Our research outcomes, reflected in the significant performance improvements of our Proposed Approach across these complex environments, owe a great deal to the rich, real-world data provided by these datasets.
